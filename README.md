#### Abstract

Parking space management is an essential aspect of urban infrastructure, influencing traffic flow, congestion, and city planning. This paper presents an innovative approach to parking space detection using advanced image processing techniques. Our research focuses on the development of a reliable, low-cost, and high-accuracy system capable of operating under diverse environmental conditions. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to recognize and monitor parking space occupancy in real-time, providing significant improvements over traditional methods. The integration of sensor fusion and edge computing is also discussed as a potential advancement in the field.
